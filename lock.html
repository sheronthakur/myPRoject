                                    Aligarh. Jain provided one interpretation regarding its origin, whereas, Nevill
                                    provided a different interpretation as follows.
                                    <span class="high-light">The History of lock manufacturing in Aligarh is interesting. Almost 125 years
                                    ago, in 1870, a gentleman from England established a firm Johnson and Company to
                                    import locks from England for sale in Aligarh.</span> In 1890, Johnson and Company started
                                    the normal production of locks on a small scale by cutting the sheets and
                                    manufacturing it with the process of molding. Besides England,<span class="high-light"> the locks made of
                                    sheet metal began to be imported from Germany for its sale in Aligarh. In 1930,
                                    Johnson and Company and some small scale units started manufacturing locks from
                                    sheet metal by duplicating German locks. These locks, which were manufactured in
                                    Aligarh, are known as Aligarh locks.</span> In 1950, Surendra Kumar an advocate by
                                    profession and the son of a barrister started manufacturing locks in a very systematic
                                    way by importing machines and techniques and even foreign engineers. However, this
                                    globally famous lock manufacturing unit has closed down due to family dispute. In
                                    1975 when the company collapsed, the engineer, contractors, mechanics, labourers
                                    employed in this large concern setup their own small scale lock units. And now
                                    Aligarh turns to the biggest lock-manufacturing hub of India.
                                    It is true that from 1950 - 1975, many Muslims made significant contributions
                                    in manufacturing of locks from share metals with the help of machines. Prominent
                                    among these were Jemco and Rose lock brands, which became very popular in those 
                                    84
                                    days. Around 1970, Aligarh manufacturers stepped into the fields of manufacturing
                                    locks for scooters and motors (Jain 2003).
                                    Work in metal is of considerable importance.<span class="high-light"> The Aligarh Postal Workshops
                                    since their establishments in 1842 or thereabouts have served as a training ground for
                                    large number of mechanics and have given them a sound knowledge of modern tools
                                    and appliances. With the adoption of wheeled carriages, mail-carts and bullock
                                    wagons, in place of runners on the main postal lines, Dr. Paton, then postmasterGeneral started the Aligarh shops, and the experiment proved more successful, almost
                                    every part of India being supplied with vehicles as well as other requirements in the
                                    shape of bags, stamps and printed forms.</span> The workshops employed as many as 2,000
                                    men after the Mutiny, and organised labour enabled Postal communication to be
                                    restored with great rapidity at that critical period. The operations of the workshops
                                    were largely curtailed after the opening of the railways, and the number of hands was
                                    reduced to 800 or 400, mainly carpenters, iron-workers, die-sinkers, and leather
                                    workers. At the present time the institution compresses a large printing establishment
                                    with a daily average of 325 hands, as well as the workshops proper. The latter
                                    employed some 370 persons, and the articles produced include scales, locks, letter
                                    boxes, furniture, badges and scales knives, lamps, lanterns metal notice and sign
                                    boards, mail and handcarts, bags, wallets and tarpaulins to these workshops may be
                                    traced the origin of the metal Industry of Aligarh, which is specially devotee to the
                                    production of locks in brass and iron.
                                    There are numerous lock works in the city, as many as 27 being in existence in
                                    1907, and others are to be founded at Iglas, Hathras and elsewhere in the district. Two
                                    firms at Aligarh employ over two hundred hands, and one is a joint stock company,
                                    Known as the pioneer lock works and general Metal Foundry, started several years 
                                    85
                                    ago by Messers Johnson and Company; while the other is known as the sparking lock
                                    works. The locks are of a high quality, and are imported in very large numbers to all
                                    parts of India. Other well known firms are those of Nabi Bakhsh and karam Ilahi and
                                    of Hafiz Inayatullah and Abdullah. The output at Aligarh is estimated at about
                                    500,000 locks per annum valued at Rs. 2,76,000. Iglas works produced locks to the
                                    value of Rs. 30,000 (Nevill 1926: 61-62). However, a real impetus to the development
                                    of the lock industry in Aligarh city came in 1926 when the Government of the country
                                    established a metal workshop to train artisans in lock making. Soon many artisans
                                    began manufacturing locks and its components at their homes with the help of their
                                    family members including children. Many families living in the adjoining villages of
                                    Aligarh city also took up this work out of their economic compulsions of insufficient
                                    income from agriculture. With this the lock industry spread to surrounding villages
                                    too. A majority of lock makers at that time were Muslims. With the partition of the
                                    country in 1947, most of Muslim master craftsmen are artisans migrated to Pakistan
                                    leaving a void and creating a slump in the lock industry. However, this situation did
                                    not continue for long. The Punjabi Hindus migrated from Pakistan to Aligarh soon
                                    realized the potential of this industry and started producing locks with the help of
                                    locally available skilled labour. The social composition of lock makers changed but
                                    production of locks on mass scale was resumed.<span class="high-light"> The Government also helped the
                                    industry by offering various incentives. The industry emerged as the most important
                                    industry of the town offering employment to a large number of people and producing
                                    lock worth crores of rupees. Today locks of different types are made in Aligarh, sent
                                    to different areas in the country and exported to many countries of the world.</span>
                                    The lock industry in Aligarh city mainly comes under small scale and cottage
